I needed a vacation so badly and I chose to go to Halong bay (not knowing how expensive itâ€™d turn out to be)

I booked my flight tickets to Hanoi in scoot for August 9th and back on 12th. I booked a very good budget hotel&nbsp;[Hanoi Serenity Hotel 2](https://www.agoda.com/hanoi-serenity-hotel-2/hotel/hanoi-vn.html) through Agoda for Aug 9th and 11th separately.&nbsp;

I booked a 2D1N trip with Stellar cruise through [halongbaytours.com](https://www.halongbaytours.com/cruise/oasis-bay-cruise.html#itinerary)&nbsp;online but they said itâ€™s fully booked and gave me a more expensive Oasis Bay Cruise instead but it was worth it. The only mistake was to trying to enjoy this cruising alone without a partner :(

## Day 1

I landed in Hanoi airport and noticed that that airport was reminiscent of my hometown Madurai's airport. That was the start of me noticing the similarities between Hanoi and Madurai.

After I landed, the taxi from hotel took me to the hotel in Old Quarter in 40 mins. I realised that the speed limits in Vietnam were very low for safety reasons.

After checking in the hotel, the receptionist helped me rent an auto-gear bike for 150k VND with petrol for 50k VND and I started riding struggling to get used to right hand side driving. 

They didn't hold my passport like they used to in Thailand and didn't even ask if I have a license. :D

This was my bike.. Not bad.

I first rode to the Temple of Literature - an ancient complex built in 1070AD.

If you like such places, you shouldn't miss [the palaces in Kerala](https://www.nativeplanet.com/travel-guide/popular-palaces-thiruvananthapuram-000170.html) if you had a chance.

Then I rode to the St. Joseph's Cathedral

We have a similar but younger [St. Mary's Cathedral](http://www.maduraitourism.co.in/saint-mary-s-cathedral-madurai) in Madurai :)

Then I rode to the very nice Hoan Kiem lake.

Similar counterpart in Madurai is the amazing [Theppakulam](https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Attraction_Review-g297677-d1932510-Reviews-Vandiyur_Mariamman_Teppakulam-Madurai_Madurai_District_Tamil_Nadu.html)

Then I drove around all night..

## Day 2

Had breakfast at the hotel and the agent from Halong Bay tours approached me to get the balance amount settled. Then after a while, a van from Oasis Bay cruise picked me up along with a lot of people.

It took 3.5 hours to get to the Halong harbour with 30mins break in the middle.

We waited for a while in the lounge before boarding the cruise.

Once aboard the cruise, we were given some instructions and the keys to our cabin.

I checked in to this amazing royal looking cabin all for myself! ðŸ˜±

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vigneshwaranr/blog_posts/master/photos/2018_08_13_vietnam/IMG_20180810_131358.jpg)

With full sized window! ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vigneshwaranr/blog_posts/master/photos/2018_08_13_vietnam/IMG_20180810_131434.jpg)


With a balcony! ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vigneshwaranr/blog_posts/master/photos/2018_08_13_vietnam/IMG_20180810_131541.jpg)

But it's a good idea to stay 3D2N trip on such cabins.

We started cruising towards Halong Bay.


![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vigneshwaranr/blog_posts/master/photos/2018_08_13_vietnam/IMG_20180810_135247.jpg)

And we were served amazing food throught the trip.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vigneshwaranr/blog_posts/master/photos/2018_08_13_vietnam/IMG_20180810_135321.jpg)


Then I went for my first ever **Kayaking** attempt through the Halong bay and I did well. 


![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vigneshwaranr/blog_posts/master/photos/2018_08_13_vietnam/me_kayaking.png)


Then some people went for swimming. I didn't after seeing some jelly fishes in the water (gulp).

Then we relaxed with a nice sunset view aboard the sundeck. And it just got more dramatic as it got darker.

Then went for early sleep with clock set to wake me up at 5:30

## Day 3

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vigneshwaranr/blog_posts/master/photos/2018_08_13_vietnam/IMG_20180811_063325.jpg)

Had breakfast and went to Sung Sot cave (Surprising cave).

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vigneshwaranr/blog_posts/master/photos/2018_08_13_vietnam/IMG_20180811_083320_HHT.jpg)

The view from atop the cave (100ft above) was very beautiful.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vigneshwaranr/blog_posts/master/photos/2018_08_13_vietnam/nice_view_atop_cave.png)

But the view from the top of Titop hill (500ft) could've been even better but it was not part of Oasis Bay's itinerary.

After this, we went back to the cruise, checked out our cabins, had buffet brunch and dropped back at the harbor. Then the van took us back to our hotels.

I checked in the same hotel and rented the bike one more time. Tried to go to any other places but just ended up finding Indian food and then just rest and TV at the hotel.

## Day 4

Had breakfast at the hotel. Then had a facial at [Trendy Spa](https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Attraction_Review-g293924-d12925605-Reviews-Trendy_Spa_Massage-Hanoi.html), had lunch, returned the bike, checked out the hotel and used their taxi service to get back to the airport.


![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vigneshwaranr/blog_posts/master/photos/2018_08_13_vietnam/IMG_20180812_132724.jpg)

Again the roads reminiscent of those in Madurai :)

Loved the souvenirs in the airport but too expensive to buy.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vigneshwaranr/blog_posts/master/photos/2018_08_13_vietnam/IMG_20180812_141943.jpg)

And finally reminded to try the famous Vietnamese coffee (no, definitely not the weasel one).

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vigneshwaranr/blog_posts/master/photos/2018_08_13_vietnam/IMG_20180812_145111.jpg)


Overall this was a very good trip but too expensive to enjoy alone.

### Lessons Learned

* A guided tour is not a good idea for traveling alone but YMMV

* If you rent a bike, check if it is in good condition and take a photo of the license plate and the location of wherever you park if you leave it and go for a longer walk.

* Riding solo requires you to stop often to check your maps

* Remember to check the check out time of your hotels

* Don't buy anything from the souvenir shop in the middle of hanoi - halong journey unless you are super rich.

* Don't mistake 10k VND for 100kVND or the other way around when you buy anything. Check the notes carefully.

* King Kong is just a fiction and doesn't really live in Halong Bay ðŸ˜¢
