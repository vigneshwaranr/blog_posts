I needed a vacation so badly and I chose to go to Halong bay (not knowing how expensive itâ€™d turn out to be)

I booked my flight tickets to Hanoi in scoot for August 9th and back on 12th. I booked a very good budget hotel&nbsp;[Hanoi Serenity Hotel 2](https://www.agoda.com/hanoi-serenity-hotel-2/hotel/hanoi-vn.html) through Agoda for Aug 9th and 11th separately.&nbsp;

I booked a 2D1N trip with Stellar cruise through [halongbaytours.com](https://www.halongbaytours.com/cruise/oasis-bay-cruise.html#itinerary)&nbsp;online but they said itâ€™s fully booked and gave me a more expensive Oasis Bay Cruise instead but it was worth it. The only mistake was to trying to enjoy this cruising alone without a partner :(

## Day 1

I landed in Hanoi airport and noticed that that airport was reminiscent of my hometown Madurai's airport. That was the start of me noticing the similarities between Hanoi and Madurai.

After I landed, the taxi from hotel took me to the hotel in Old Quarter in 40 mins. I realised that the speed limits in Vietnam were very low for safety reasons.

After checking in the hotel, the receptionist helped me rent an auto-gear bike for 150k VND with petrol for 50k VND and I started riding struggling to get used to right hand side driving. 

They didn't hold my passport like they used to in Thailand and didn't even ask if I have a license. :D

This was my bike.. Not bad.

I first rode to the Temple of Literature - an ancient complex built in 1070AD.

If you like such places, you shouldn't miss [the palaces in Kerala](https://www.nativeplanet.com/travel-guide/popular-palaces-thiruvananthapuram-000170.html) if you had a chance.

Then I rode to the St. Joseph's Cathedral

We have a similar but younger [St. Mary's Cathedral](http://www.maduraitourism.co.in/saint-mary-s-cathedral-madurai) in Madurai :)

Then I rode to the very nice Hoan Kiem lake.

Similar counterpart in Madurai is the amazing [Theppakulam](https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Attraction_Review-g297677-d1932510-Reviews-Vandiyur_Mariamman_Teppakulam-Madurai_Madurai_District_Tamil_Nadu.html)

Then I drove around all night..

## Day 2

Had breakfast at the hotel and the agent from Halong Bay tours approached me to get the balance amount settled. Then after a while, a van from Oasis Bay cruise picked me up along with a lot of people.

It took 3.5 hours to get to the Halong harbour with 30mins break in the middle.

We waited for a while in the lounge before boarding the cruise.

Once aboard the cruise, we were given some instructions and the keys to our cabin.

I checked in to this amazing royal looking cabin all for myself! ðŸ˜±

We started cruising towards Halong Bay.

And we were served amazing food throught the trip.

Then I went for my first ever **Kayaking** attempt through the Halong bay and I did well.

Then some people went for swimming. I didn't after seeing some jelly fishes in the water (gulp).

Then we relaxed with a nice sunset view aboard the sundeck. And it just got more dramatic as it got darker.

Then went for early sleep with clock set to wake me up at 5:30
