I needed a vacation so badly and I chose to go to Halong bay (not knowing how expensive it’d turn out to be)

I booked my flight tickets to Hanoi in scoot for August 9th and back on 12th. I booked a very good budget hotel&nbsp;[Hanoi Serenity Hotel 2](https://www.agoda.com/hanoi-serenity-hotel-2/hotel/hanoi-vn.html) through Agoda for Aug 9th and 11th separately.&nbsp;

I booked Stellar cruise through [halongbaytours.com](https://www.halongbaytours.com/cruise/oasis-bay-cruise.html#itinerary)&nbsp;online but they said it’s fully booked and gave me a more expensive Oasis Bay Cruise instead but it was worth it. The only mistake was to trying to enjoy this cruising alone without a partner :(

I landed in Hanoi airport and noticed that that airport was reminiscent of my hometown Madurai's airport. That was the start of me noticing the similarities between Hanoi and Madurai.

After I landed, the taxi from hotel took me to the hotel in Old Quarter in 40 mins. I realised that the speed limits in Vietnam were very low for safety reasons.

The hotel receptionist helped me rent an auto-gear bike for 150k VND with petrol for 50k VND and I started riding struggling to get used to right hand side driving.
